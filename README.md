# kMeansPy
Simple python implementation of the k-means algorithm. Helpful because at first glance it lacks the difficult mathematical intricacies of other algorithms, and is thus less daunding to master.

# Development Plans
1. Different data label initializations
2. Tutorial via a jupyter notebook
3. A measure/factor of convergence
4. Examples using high dimensional data
5. Various more efficient implementations
